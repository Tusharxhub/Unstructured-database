# Unstructured Database

A practical repository focused on understanding, designing, and working with **unstructured databases**.  
This project explores how unstructured data is stored, queried, and managed using modern NoSQL concepts and tools.

---

## 📌 About the Project

Traditional relational databases work well with structured data, but modern applications often deal with data that has no fixed schema.  
This repository is created to study and experiment with **unstructured and semi-structured data models**, their use cases, and real-world handling techniques.

The project is aimed at:
- Learning core concepts of unstructured databases
- Understanding schema-less data storage
- Practicing queries and operations on NoSQL databases

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Unstructured vs Structured Data
- Schema-less Databases
- Document-based Databases
- Collections and Documents
- CRUD Operations
- Indexing Basics
- Real-world use cases

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** (Primary database)
- **Mongosh** (MongoDB Shell)
- **JavaScript** (for examples and queries)
- **JSON / BSON** data formats

## 📊 Example Document

```json
{
  "name": "User A",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "MongoDB", "Next.js"],
  "projects": {
    "title": "DevMatch",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

This flexibility is what makes unstructured databases powerful for modern applications.
